I'm a PhD Candidate in the Automotive Engineering department at Clemson Univeristy, more commonly known as the Clemson Univeristy International Center for Automotive Research. I work at the Automation, Robotics and Mechatronics Lab here under the advisement of two professors -- Dr Venkat Krovi and Dr Matthias Schmid. I have an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from Ramaiah Institute of Technology (RIT) and I have spent two years at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) working on developing agricultural sensors.

Currently, I am working on an NSF funded project to design and deploy a cable robot based manipulator for concrete delivery. I also manage the scaled vehicle group in our lab, advising and guiding students that work on these platforms. I co-teach the "AuE893: Autonomy, Science and Systems" course along with Dr Venkat Krovi, training the students in using ROS for deploying autonomy algorithms. I am currently also an instructor and content developer at the Robotics Bootcamp Pilot program deployed by SAE.
